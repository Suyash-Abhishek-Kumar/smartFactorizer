    <h2>Smart Factorizer</h2>
    <p>The program prime factorizes the user input number and then compresses each prime factor separately.<br>
    It also breaks down any prime numbers it encounters while factorizing the original number.<br>
    Finally, it give the user 3 variants of the answer: +, -, =<br>
    + means the factorizing added 1 to any new prime factors encountered<br>
    - means the factorizing subtracted 1 from any new prime factors encountered<br>
    = means the factorizing added or subtracted 1 to/from any new prime factors encountered based on the coded logic</p>
